# Encrypting and Decrypting Data Using Azure Key Vault
This repository demonstrates how to securely encrypt and decrypt data using an RSA key stored in Azure Key Vault, ensuring that the private key never leaves the cloud environment.
The project covers the complete implementation process, from provisioning Azure resources with Azure CLI to integrating Azure Key Vault into a .NET console application. By leveraging the Azure.Security.KeyVault.Keys package, the solution enables seamless cryptographic operations without exposing sensitive key material, enhancing data security in cloud-based applications.
